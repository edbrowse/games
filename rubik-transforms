A human solves the cube quite differently from a computer.
Here are some handy procedures and transforms.
A transform is a sequence of moves that alters 2 or 3 pieces
but leaves the remaining pieces undisturbed.

Standard:
Flip the top side pieces up to the top level, oriented correctly.
Turn down a face grab a corner and pull it up oriented.
Do this for 3 corners.
Using the fourth corner not yet set, turn down and pull up 3 middle side pieces oriented.
Arrange the fourth corner and side to be together and aligned.
Turn down and pull them up completing the top two layers.
Flip over so bottom layer becomes top, so you can see it.
Number corners 1 through 4 clockwise, and assume 3 and 4 must swap:
RTrftFRtr then TT
If 1 and 4 must swap:
t then RTrfTTFRtr
Equivalently if 1 and 2 must swap and 3 and 4 must swap:
RTrfTTFRtr
Use 6 move transform and its inverse rBRFBf FbfrbR
to change the orientation of 2 of the 4 corners.
Repeat until all corners are oriented.
If you need to spin 1 2 and 4 clockwise, more efficient:
RTrTRTTr then TT
If you need to spin 1 2 and 3 counterclockwise:
ltLtlTTL then TT
If front and left side must flip, leaving back alone:
RFLRRTbFFtBlfr
If front and right side must flip, leaving back alone:
RFLFFtBRRTblfr
If left and right side must flip, leaving back alone:
frTFlRTTLrFtRF
To permute front right and back sides:
RRbFFlRTTLrBRR

Pocket:
Flip the top side pieces up to the top level, oriented correctly.
Flip over so bottom layer becomes top, so you can see it.
Number corners 1 through 4 clockwise, and assume 3 and 4 must swap.
RTrftFRtr then TT
If 1 and 4 must swap:
t then RTrfTTFRtr
Use 6 move transform and its inverse rBRFBf FbfrbR
to change the orientation of 2 of the 4 corners.
Repeat until all corners are oriented.
If you need to spin 1 2 and 4 clockwise:
RTrTRTTr then TT
If you need to spin 1 2 and 3 counterclockwise:
ltLtlTTL then TT

Slanted:
Hold with large layer on top and edge toward you, 45 degrees off from the standard cube.
Flip up 3 of the 4 top sides oriented correctly.
Move top around and spin sides so that all centers are oriented.
Keep the last top side on the bottom out of the way,
spin the last center, move the side piece around below it,
flip up, so all top sides are in place like a plus sign, and all centers are oriented.
Turn down a face grab a corner and pull it up oriented.
Do this for 3 corners.
Using the fourth corner not yet set, turn down and pull up 3 middle side pieces oriented.
Arrange the fourth corner and side to be together and aligned.
Turn down and pull them up completing the top two layers.
Flip over so bottom layer becomes top, so you can see it.
All corners are the same so already in position.
Use 6 move transform and its inverse rBRFBf FbfrbR
to change the orientation of 2 of the 4 corners.
Repeat until all corners are oriented.
If you need to spin 1 2 and 4 clockwise:
RTrTRTTr then TT
If you need to spin 1 2 and 3 counterclockwise:
ltLtlTTL then TT
If front and left side must flip, leaving back alone:
RFLRRTbFFtBlfr
If front and right side must flip, leaving back alone:
RFLFFtBRRTblfr
If left and right side must flip, leaving back alone:
frTFlRTTLrFtRF
Flip back over and look at the centers.
If front center must flip:
RRbFFlRTTLrBRR.
